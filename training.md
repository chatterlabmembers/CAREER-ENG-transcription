# Training

:exclamation:**NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE COMPLETED ACLEW ANNOTATION SCHEME GOLD STANDARD TRAINING BEFORE DOING TRANSCRIPTION**:exclamation: 

Because our instructions for this task are slightly different from the standard AAS instructions, you will also need to complete some project-specific training.

## Training files
Click the links below to download the training files. For each training set, you will find 3 files at the associated link: (1) a 5-minute-long wav file, (2) an eaf file that you will edit, and (3) an eaf file with gold-standard ("GS") annotations that you will use to compare against yours. **Please do not look at the GS annotations before you have _fully completed and checked_ the matching porition of your own file**.

## Training procedure
* Review the [ACLEW minCHAT slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WXlAR4JHrdvaavyv86ZJiKk7DCr9iPs3VAX9ls4CPjY/edit#slide=id.g7a674d1b05_0_0) before beginning your first training file and reference these and/or the cheatsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTLT0UXTRLiTyTVrhPJpoIB82HSOR5GpCQfi2Tsqdug/edit) when you are transcribing all files
* Follow the standard [Annotation workflow](./README.md#annotation-workflow) instructions on the main page, but please **annotate files 1 minute of the recording at a time**.
* After you complete each minute:
	* Reference [these instructions](./README.md#minchat-checker) and upload your eaf file to the minCHAT checker
		* Correct errors as needed and remember that the checker only gives you a list of _potential_ errors, meaning that some of the "errors" it catches are fine to keep. Reference the AAS slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WXlAR4JHrdvaavyv86ZJiKk7DCr9iPs3VAX9ls4CPjY/edit#slide=id.g7a674d1b05_0_0) as needed
		* Take note of any questions for discussion with Subin/the annotation team at the next opportunity
	* Upload your eaf file to the [gold-standard comparison app](https://aclew.shinyapps.io/aclew-compare-eafs/)
		* Enter the specific minute you want to test (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5)
		* Check the box to ignore dependent tiers
		* Screen shot your error report and send to Subin (on Slack) with the following additional information:
			* Training file number
			* Minute number
			* Any questions you have about this minute
* After completing all 5 minutes of the recording, proceed to the next training file. If you have completed all training files, then review the instructions for the main coding again ([here](./README.md#annotation-workflow)) and begin with the first available file on the Annotation File Tracker.

Thank you!
