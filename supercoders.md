# Super Coder Instructions

As a super coder, your job will be to help us quality check annotations from members of the RA team. 

For each completed file on the [Annotation File Tracker](https://uchicago.app.box.com/file/1167435490002) (i.e., unhighlighted rows with "DONE" in the `Last minute annotated` column) that was not coded by you _or_ the lab mangager:

* Find the current version of the annotations in the ["completed" folder on Box](https://uchicago.app.box.com/folder/199422689005)
	* 2 annotators' initials listed? Use the second set of initials (after the /)
	* Annotations missing from the "completed" folder? First check with the RA who completed the annotations and then with the lab manager if needed

* Add information to the 3 green columns on the [Annotation File Tracker](https://uchicago.app.box.com/file/1167435490002):
	* `Super coder`: your initials
	* `Super coder completed check date`: date that you completed the final version of your quality checks
	* `Super coder annotation guide version`: the most up to date version of the annotation instructions at the time of quality checking

* Listen to the full 5min clip and correct any errors. See [common errors](#common-errors-to-fix) below, which primarily include transcription and diarization errors, but segmentation errors should also be fixed as needed
	* **How accurate do annotation boundaries have to be?** Don’t agonize over perfect onset and offset boundaries for each utterance, but please do make sure that the entire utterance is captured within the bounds of your annotation: If you play back the annotation, you should be able to hear the complete utterance. Annotations should not include hearable silences at the start and finish.

* Once you have completed your corrections (or confirmed that no corrections are needed), then upload the updated ELAN file to the "checked" subfolder of your ["completed" folder on Box](https://uchicago.app.box.com/folder/199422689005)

## Common errors to fix
* Missing participant names from tier attributes (check with ⌘ T)
* Miscoded TCDL vs. ODL
* Unintelligble speech ("xxx") that is actually partially or fully intelligible
* Transcriptions that do not match minCHAT rules
* Mislabeled speaker tiers
