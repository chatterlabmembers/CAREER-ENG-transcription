# CAREER OH Speech Segmentation

❗**NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE COMPLETED ACLEW ANNOTATION SCHEME GOLD STANDARD TRAINING + CAREER ENG TRANSCRIPTION TRAINING BEFORE SEGMENTATION**❗

## Brief background

TBA

### Current task overview

A small portion of the transcribed clips from the parent project `CAREER-ENG-transcription` were randomly sampled. Chatter Lab RA's will be segmenting overheard speech, or speech that is not directed at TC (target child), in those clips.

### What's here

On this page, you can find:

1. Folders needed for segmentation
2. Workflow on how to set up files for segmentation

## Segmentation workflow

To begin segmentation, you must have access to the following folders and application:

1. [CAREER transcription team](https://uchicago.app.box.com/folder/198109383319)
2. [CAREER OH speech segmentation](https://uchicago.app.box.com/folder/346086493250)
3. [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan/download)

Open all three items listed above, follow the following workflow to begin your segmentation session.

### Part I: Locate files

1. In [CAREER OH speech segmentation](https://uchicago.app.box.com/folder/346086493250), open [OH speech segmentation file tracker](https://uchicago.app.box.com/file/2017072696161).
2. Locate the file name of the file you last worked on or the next un-segmented file. If you are starting on a fresh, un-segmented file, add your initials to `Segmentation annotator` and today's date to `First date worked on` columns.
3. Once you have located a file name, download the associated .wav file from `Recording URL` column.
4. Search and download the file name ending in .eaf format in [CAREER transcription team > annotator_files > completed](https://uchicago.app.box.com/folder/199422689005). *You will notice there are likely multiple versions of the same file you are searching for; download the lastest dated version (most likely under another annotator's "checks" folder)*
5. When you have both .wav and .eaf files, open them in [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan/download).

### Part II: Set up files for segmentation

1. Double check the .wav and .eaf files' names match.
2. TBA


*If you want a visual version on how to set up files for segmentation, Dr. Casillas made a video tutorial, and the link to the tutorial can be found in [CAREER OH speech segmentation](https://uchicago.app.box.com/folder/346086493250) folder.*

### Part III: Overheard speech segmentation

1. **Double check the file you are working on is set up correctly!**
2. Segment all lexical vocalizations from non-TC speakers (you should not have to segment any vocalizations from TC or from other speakers that are TC-directed since they should have been segmented and transcribed beforehand).
3. Pay attention to utterance boundaries and speaker assignments.
4. Once you are done segmenting a clip, input the speaker tiers and nicknames in the `Speaker ID` tab under [OH speech segmentation file tracker](https://uchicago.app.box.com/file/2017072696161).
